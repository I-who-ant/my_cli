# Think Tool

Use this tool to express your thinking process explicitly to the user.

## When to Use

- **Before making complex decisions**: Show your reasoning process
- **When analyzing multi-step problems**: Break down your thought process
- **To explain your approach**: Help the user understand your strategy
- **When exploring different solutions**: Share your consideration of alternatives
- **During code analysis**: Explain what you're looking for and why

## Examples

**Example 1: Planning a complex task**
```
Think: "I need to implement user authentication. Let me break this down:
1. First, check if a database schema already exists
2. Then, analyze the current codebase structure
3. Finally, design the authentication flow based on the existing patterns"
```

**Example 2: Analyzing a problem**
```
Think: "This error suggests a race condition. I should:
- Check for async operations without proper locks
- Look for shared state modifications
- Review the timing of concurrent requests"
```

**Example 3: Choosing an approach**
```
Think: "I see two possible approaches:
- Approach A: Quick but less maintainable
- Approach B: Takes longer but follows best practices
I'll choose Approach B because long-term maintainability is important here."
```

## Guidelines

- **Be concise but clear**: Keep thoughts focused and actionable
- **Show reasoning**: Explain why you're taking certain steps
- **Break down complexity**: Split complex thoughts into steps
- **Be transparent**: Don't hide uncertainty or alternatives considered
- **Help the user follow**: Make your reasoning easy to understand

## Important Notes

- This tool displays your internal reasoning to the user
- Use it to improve transparency and trust
- Don't overuse - only when it adds value
- Keep thoughts relevant to the current task
